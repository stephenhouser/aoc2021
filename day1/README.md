# Day 1: Sonar Sweep

Pretty simple, read list of numbers into a vector and count the number of increasing numbers in the sequence. Nothing fancy. Good warm up. Could not think of a standard library function, or functional way to approach it.

Part 2 just needed the sum of windows of size 3 through the data, then the same number of increasing numbers in the threesome sequences.
